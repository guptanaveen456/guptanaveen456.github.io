- **Imperative:** The logic definition adheres to the imperative programming paradigm
- **StronglyTyped:** Provides a Strong Type System for the primary components of the Metadata, but it also allows for some dynamictypes to be used in the logic definitions
- **Relational:** Enables the definition of an Object Model which is based on Relational Model and supports relationships like Association, Composition & Aggregation
- **Aspect-Oriented:** Enables adding of cross-cutting functionality based on annotations like in an aspect-oriented programming paradigm
- **Persistence:** Enables configurable Object-Relational Mapping based persistence mechanism for the user data
