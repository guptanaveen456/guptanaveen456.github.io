Business Logic Templates are a feature of the Metadata built into the M1 abstraction space 
leveraging the concepts and features provided by the Metamodel, M2 level. These 
templates provide a structure to the design of logic flow to configure the business specific 
functionalities. As such, these templates add another abstraction layer on top of the 
Metamodel features to provide a way for simpler configuration experience for the end users. 
There are a couple of basic Business Logic Templates, out-of-the-box. Since the templates 
themselves are bootstrapped into the configurable Metadata, the M1 space, users could 
define their own templates or customize existing templates, as needed. Out-of-the-box 
templates include:
- Service Templates, such as, Modelling, Shopfloor, Inquiry, Compound, etc.
- Feature Templates, such as Where Used, Electronic Signatures, etc.
