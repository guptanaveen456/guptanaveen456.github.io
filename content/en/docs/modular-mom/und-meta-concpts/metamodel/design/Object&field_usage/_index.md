‘Usages’, as exist in Opcenter Ex Core, are a concept that allows for configuring some cross cutting feature functionality on Configurable Objects & Fields. Examples of such features 
include: 
- Specify Object Category
- Represent Special Fields
- Toggle Caching
- Enable WIP Messages
- Toggle Reversibility
- Etc.
Object Category: Object category, such as Named, Revisioned, Service etc., is a type of Usage 
that defines certain aspects of the Configurable Objects.
Special Fields: Fields like ‘Name’ property of a Named object or a ‘Revision’ Field of a 
Revisioned objects fall under this category of special fields since they have certain specific 
functionality defined for them. 
Caching: This toggle determines whether an object can be cached at runtime. It provides for a 
mechanism to toggle this feature per Object definition for fine grained control of caching.
WIP Messages: Work in progress (WIP) messages can be defined for specific modeling objects 
so that the message appears to a user when a traceable material with specific attributes 
reaches a certain processing point.
Reversibility: Toggle for Transaction reversibility \< To PrM: do we need this? \>
