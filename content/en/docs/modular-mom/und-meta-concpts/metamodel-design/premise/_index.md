A business analyst is one who is more business focused and less involved with technology,
whereas, a technologist, like a solutions architect or a software developer, is more
technology focused. The primary intention for this Metamodel design is to be able to cater to
a business analyst needs, in much the same was as catering to a more technology-oriented
persona.
