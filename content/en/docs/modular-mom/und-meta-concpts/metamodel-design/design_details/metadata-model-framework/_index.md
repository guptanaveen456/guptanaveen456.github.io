Metadata Model Framework provides the basis for the definition of Metadata. This
framework implements the Configurable Object and all the plumbing needed to support this
Metamodel. The primary pillars of this framework are the **Base Class Library** and the **Runtime
Class Library** which define the framework for the Configurable Object and, also provide the
runtime execution support.
