Metamodel is a like programming language that allows to configure the business model, the
domain model, the business logic and other aspects of the business model. Modular MOM
Metamodel leverages a ubiquitous programming language and transforms it into a language
capable of configuring all aspects of a business model.

The widely popular, open-source, dotnet core-based platform agnostic, object-oriented,
aspect-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language ‘ **C#’** is used as the base. An
abstraction layer is built on top to define the conceptual DSL for the Modular MOM
Metamodel.
