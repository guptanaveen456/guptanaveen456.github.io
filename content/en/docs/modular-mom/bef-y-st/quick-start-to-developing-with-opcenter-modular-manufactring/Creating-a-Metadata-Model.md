# **Modular MOM : Creating a Metadata Model**  -->
Created by Alvarez Villanueva, Beatriz, last modified on Dec 09, 2021 

Opcenter Modular Manufacturing is based on the Metadata-driven architecture so the Metamodel is used to define the Metadata for Opcenter Modular Manufacturing, that is, to configure the business objects and processes used by Opcenter Modular Manufacturing applications .

To create a Metamodel you have to create the related Solution and populate it with entities. To better configure the model, a default template is provided and its folder structure (the same as the template repository) is organized to incorporate repositories as submodules in order to store separately the Model dependencies in their own git repos. These submodules can be shared among other modules to automatically update the submodules code when the related repository is updated. 
## **Folder Structure**
The folder structure of the sample model **M1\_Model** is the following:

- Model project: **M1\_Model** 
  - props
  - config
  - .gitmodules
  - Submodule
    - source code for the submodule
- Test project: **M1\_Model.Tests**
- Integration test project:  **M1\_Model.IntegrationTests**
- **NuGets** folder
- Docker file
- Generate commands
## **Procedure**
1. Click the link <https://tfs05mom.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/MOM/ModularMOM/_git/WS_M1_Template> 
1. In the TFS breadcrumb displayed on top select **M1\_Template** as the repository for create the Metamodel solution and select **master** as branch in the drop-down list box below: the **M1\_Template** is displayed.
1. At the top right corner, select **Clone** and then the **Visual Studio** option to clone the repository.
1. Browse for the repository location and rename the template folder with the name of the module that will contain the configured solution and its defined structure.
1. In Visual Studio, check out the local branch.
1. Perform the following operations in order to be aligned with the template name:
   1. Update **props**.
   1. Update credentials and NuGet paths in **conf**.
   1. Update the URL of desired submodule repository in the **.gitmodule**
   1. Check that the **NuGet** folder is created in the repository to manage all NuGet packages.
1. In Visual Studio, open the solution and add the Metamodel classes inherited from the framework ones. In order to be persisted in the database, the information regarding any class is written in the following files:
   1. *entityname.***cs**: contains the business logic and any other logic to be written in this C# class, it can be inherited from the following base classes:
      1. NamedObject if it has to be named object
      1. NameSubentityOf<T> in case of SubEntities
   1. *entityname*.**json**: specifies any configuration and composition on this C# class and allows to configure persistence table and column information for the defined field.
   1. **entityService.cs**: contains logic which can be exposed as API to external system. Available framework defined templates:
      1. NamedDataService for CRUD operations on entities
      1. ShopFloorService for implement operations performed in MES system.
1. Define the corresponding class properties.
1. Update the dll path in the batch script to generate and build models for APIs
1. Create the Docker Image and put it in the root directory.

Note that in case of new Metamodel class or service, each configurable object must be decorated with the attribute **COTypeId**(“<CO Type Id value>)” and the value of **COTypeId** has to be uniquely generated by using the **IdGenerator.Tool** present in MetadataRuntime solution.
## **Result**
The Metadata Model is created Note that  you can repeat this procedure to create as many Models as you want in order to compose Apps to finally create the Product.

|<p>[Alvarez Villanueva, Beatriz](https://momwiki02.industrysoftware.automation.siemens.com/display/~ITR00446) Hello in this page there're references to WS\_M1\_\* repositories, as far as I know they're obsolete. Please note that also this page: [Developing an App / Metadata Module](c:\users\anil.birajdar\desktop\temp\134455247.html) shows similar information, Am I wrong?</p><p>![](Creating-a-Metadata-Model\_115692078.002.png) Posted by ITR00527 at Oct 26, 2021 16:10 </p>|
