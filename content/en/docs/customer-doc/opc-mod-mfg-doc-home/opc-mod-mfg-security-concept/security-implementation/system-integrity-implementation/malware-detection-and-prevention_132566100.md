This section focuses on protecting the automation system and its computers against malicious software. Malicious software and malicious programs (malware) refer to computer programs that have been developed to execute undesirable and possible damaging functions. There are various types of malware available:

- computer viruses
- computer worms
- trojan horses
- other potentially-dangerous programs, such as:
  - backdoor
  - spyware
  - adware
  - scareware
  - grayware.

A virus scanner or antivirus program is a software that detects, blocks and, if necessary, removes malware.

The use of a virus scanner on the computers of an automation plant must not interfere with the plant's process mode. The following two examples illustrate two situations which may arise on a production system where a virus scanner is used:

- Even when infected with malware, a computer might not be switched off by a virus scanner, this could then lead to losing control of the production system (for example, for an OS server).
- A project file "infected" by malware (for example, a database archive) might not be automatically moved to quarantine, blocked or deleted.

It is advisable to use a virus scanner with server-client configuration where:

- The virus scanner server is a computer that centrally manages virus scan clients, downloads virus signature files (virus patterns) from the virus scanner vendor sites and distributes them to the virus scanner clients.
- the virus scanner client is a computer that is checked for malware and managed by the virus scanner server.

In accordance with the rules for distributing components into security cells, the virus scanner server must be singled out in a separate network (Perimeter network / DMZ).
