In information security, the term *integrity* refers to something that is not subject to unauthorized changes, such as data, services. Increasing system integrity should be regarded as the third pillar of a balanced security concept. To improve system integrity, you have to use automation systems and controller components, such as SCADA and HMI systems, which are protected against unauthorized access and malware or that meet special requirements such as know-how protection.

Customizations can be performed by System Integrators. However, you must consider that the effects of the product and of the custom code must be distinguished. This distinction can be implemented via auditing custom code execution and deployment, or providing coding guidelines and making the customers responsible for compliant code and/or tracking execution.
