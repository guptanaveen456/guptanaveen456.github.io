This topic encompasses the patch management for the Windows clients.Â 

In general, office PC systems are protected against malware. Any weak points that are discovered in the operating system, in Microsoft SQL Server or in the user software must be eliminated by installing updates and patches. Likewise, industrial PCs and PC-based control systems in the plant network require corresponding protective measures.

Systems should be updated and patched on a regular basis to address potential security risks and known exploits. To accomplish this, Microsoft removes security gaps in its products and provides these corrections to its customers via official updates/patches.

To ensure secure and stable operation in Opcenter Modular Manufacturing, the installation of "Security patches" and "Critical patches" is recommended. Siemens will provide customer support only if these updates have been installed and solely for problems that are unrelated to such updates.

You can find information on Microsoft updates and the Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) on the following Microsoft page:

The support for implementing patch management in your system is available from the Industrial Security Services. You can find additional information and the corresponding contacts at the following Siemens webpage:
