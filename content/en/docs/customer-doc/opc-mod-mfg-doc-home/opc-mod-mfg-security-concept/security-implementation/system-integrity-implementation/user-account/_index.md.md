Configuring access controls on the basis of user rights and privileges contributes to System Integrity.
A safe user account management foresees that specific users may access only specific parts of the system, devices or applications. Some users have administrator rights, whereas others have only read and/or write access rights.
Managing user and operator permissions involves the [assignment of roles to users and user groups](C:\Users\anil.birajdar\Desktop\confl\ModMOM\Assignment-of-Roles-to-Users-and-User-Groups_132566097.html), this procedure is strictly applied under the principle of minimum required rights.
