In order to grant network security, access points to security cells and communication between the different access points have to be secured.

It is a good practice to permit access to security cells only through clearly-defined access points: security cells should have a single access point. The access through access points is permitted only after having verified the legitimacy of the access request (people and/or devices must be authenticated and authorized). Furthermore, it is advisable to log any access.

Access points should prevent unauthorized data traffic to security cells while permitting authorized traffic necessary for smooth system operation. The access point to a security cell can be designed according to configuration and functionality requirements. A network in which all data traffic is protected by a firewall represents an example of a security cell with a security access point.

Firewalls must be configured with rules to mitigate DDoS attacks.
