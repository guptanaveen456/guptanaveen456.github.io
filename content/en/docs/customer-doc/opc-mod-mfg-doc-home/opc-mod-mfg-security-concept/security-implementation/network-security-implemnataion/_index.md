Network security represents the core of the Industrial Security concept. This includes protecting automation networks from unauthorized access and checking all interfaces towards other networks, such as an office network and, in particular, remote access to the Internet. Also, network security encompasses protecting communication from interception and manipulation (for example, encryption during data transfer and authentication of the respective communication nodes).

One strategy used for increasing overall system availability that can effectively mitigate security risks is the segmentation of the network into a set of so-called security cells. Each cell is conceived to cover a specific business function and has a dedicated protected network. As a result, devices within a cell can be protected from unauthorized access from the outside without affecting real-time capabilities, performance or other functions. Security threats that result in failure can thus be restricted to the immediate area.

A particular type of security cell is the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which can be used to isolate certain applications from external networks.
