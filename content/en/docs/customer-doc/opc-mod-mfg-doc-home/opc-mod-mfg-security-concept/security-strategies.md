This section refers only to Opcenter Modular Manufacturing security. For concepts related to the security of other Opcenter products or third-party products, please refer to their documentation.

Computer systems and networks are inherently vulnerable to a wide variety of security threats that can be prevented or reduced by adopting specific security countermeasures. Each of these technical measures is specific to a certain attack (viruses cannot be prevented with firewalls) and can cover only a subset of the necessary protection goals. Nevertheless, only an overall strategy can provide effective protection.

The Siemens Industrial Security concept corresponds to a multi-layer defense, known as defense-in-depth concept. This strategy consists of several defense layers that protect a system, in this case the MOM/MES system:

- **Plant Security Layer**: Plant security ensures that technical IT security measures cannot be bypassed somehow. This includes physical-access protection measures (such as fences, turnstiles, cameras or card-readers) and organizational measures (in particular, a security management process) for ensuring long-term plant security.
- **Network Security Layer**: Network security is the central element of the Industrial Security concept. This includes measures to protect automation networks from unauthorized access and check all interfaces towards other networks, such as an office network and, in particular, remote access to the Internet. Network security also encompasses protecting communication from interception and manipulation (for example, encryption during data transfer and authentication of the respective communication nodes).
- **System Integrity Layer**: Securing system integrity should be regarded as the third pillar of a balanced security concept. This is ensured by using automation systems and controller components that are protected against unauthorized access and malware or meet special requirements, such as know-how protection.
