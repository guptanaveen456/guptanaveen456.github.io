A password policy is a set of rules designed to enhance computer security by encouraging users to employ strong passwords and use them properly.

- To protect your password, it is important to change it periodically and keep your password private, since anybody who knows your password may access your account.
- Use a different password from that you use on other sites. If you need help remembering your password, write it down and place it in your purse, wallet, or another secure location.
- Use at least 16 characters. A minimum of 8 is required; a maximum of 256 is allowed.
- A strong password should contain at least one upper-case and one lower-case letter, one numerical digit and one special character.
- Choose an original password. Passwords previously used for your account will not be accepted by the system.
- Avoid using passwords that are easy to guess. These include passwords such as "password" or "123456". They also include things like a dictionary word, your name, e-mail address, or other personal information that can easily be obtained.
- Passwords are case sensitive. For instance, "CLOUDS3!%" and "clouds3!%" are two different passwords. When choosing a password, remember the capitalization you use, and make sure that the CAPS LOCK key on your keyboard is not turned on.
