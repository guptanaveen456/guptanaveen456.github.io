Product Excellence Program (“PEP”) helps DISW to understand how customers use its Offerings. DISW uses this data to continuously improve its Offerings. PEP is designed to protect the privacy of the User and the intellectual property created through the use of DISW Offerings.

How does it work?

PEP is used to collect data about your installation, the features you use, and how you use them. The data is sent to DISW for analysis. By examining usage patterns from a large number of people, DISW gains insight into how the Offerings are used and how to improve the software in future releases. Data collection occurs in the background as you use the software and does not affect performance or functionality.

What data is sent?

The data collected can vary by product and by release as Siemens gains more insight or adds new capabilities. PEP may collect data on the functions utilized, the operating environment (e.g.: OS, RAM, graphics, etc.), the product version, or other indications of User interaction. The data may also include the company name that is using the Offering. This data is solely for use by DISW to improve its Offerings and is never shared with any third party.

What about privacy?

Protecting your privacy is important to Siemens. Any personal information will be hashed using SHA-256 encryption on a device/application level and will be aggregated.
