Cloud security refers to a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect data, applications, and the associated infrastructure of cloud computing.

Cloud systems are vulnerable to a wide variety of security threats that can be prevented or reduced by adopting specific security countermeasures. Each of these technical measures is specific to a certain attack and can cover only a subset of the necessary protection goals. Nevertheless, only an overall strategy can provide effective protection.

Data security plays an important role in all online transmissions. Encrypted communication as well as the use of certified data centers for processing and storing the data ensure high security.

All best practices concerning security controls and policies have been put in place to safeguard any weaknesses in the system and reduce the effect of an attack.

As the Product is accessed via Internet, Customers and Users are asked to set-up and apply all well-known security measures inherent to the usage of an Internet web site, including the verification of the presence of a valid site certificate, the usage of an up-to-date browser compatible with the Product and the verification that the browser is connected to a well-known URL.

Customization can be performed by System Integrators. However, you must consider that the effects of the product and of the custom code must be distinguished. This distinction can be implemented via auditing custom code execution and deployment or providing coding guidelines and making customers responsible for compliant code and/or tracking execution.

In particular, the following security aspects have been considered:

- the software is deployed using antimalware and antivirus programs that include anti-virus, anti-malware, intrusion detection/prevention; a [secure connection certificate](C:\Users\anil.birajdar\Desktop\confl\ModMOM\Secure-Connection-Certificate_145443591.html) is issued for the Opcenter Modular Manufacturing website
- a [password policy](C:\Users\anil.birajdar\Desktop\confl\ModMOM\Password-Policy_132566111.html) is recommended to enhance the security of users' accounts
- [data privacy](C:\Users\anil.birajdar\Desktop\confl\ModMOM\Data-Privacy_145443596.html)
